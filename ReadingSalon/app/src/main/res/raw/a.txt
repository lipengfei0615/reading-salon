It’s been 10 years since the publication of Winslow’s The Power of the Dog, which featured DEA agent Art Keller leading the charge against the Mexican cartels in the never-ending War on Drugs. After having put his onetime friend and eventual cartel king, Adán Barrera, in prison and killing his two brothers, Keller left the agency and took up tending bees in a monastery. But, in 2004, Barrera arranges his transfer to a Mexican prison, which leads quickly to his escape, and the war between competing cartels is ignited all over again. Reluctantly but inevitably, Keller joins the fight once more and, for the next eight years, working undercover in Mexico, directs the effort to find and kill Barrera.

Winslow’s riveting and tragic epic seamlessly blends fact and fiction to tell the incredible, heartbreaking story of those blood-drenched years (in 2010 alone, there were 15,723 drug-war-related deaths in Mexico). Jumping from detailed but never less than compelling discussion of the logistics behind the cartel’s operation to the story of the people involved, Winslow draws the reader in with rich portraits of not only Keller and Barrera but also other cartel figures, DEA agents, and Mexican drug fighters, journalists, and innocent victims. The main subplot, concerning a group of journalists in Juárez and their seemingly hopeless attempt to cover the cartel’s atrocities without becoming victims themselves, is really a novel within a novel, but remarkably, Winslow never loses control of his subject or his characters, despite the book’s scope and complexity. There is some of The Godfather here, but Winslow’s characterizations, though certainly multidimensional, have more of an edge to them than do Puzo’s, a greater recognition of the tragedy a violent power struggle leaves in its wake. Clearly one of the most ambitious and most accomplished crime novels to appear in the last 15 years, The Cartel will likely retain that distinction even as the twenty-first century grinds on.
